            <p>
                There are many online writing sites where people can compose written works, both fictional or
                non-fictional.
                Poetry is one of the types of writing on them, and this is a good place for it! Here, novice to
                experienced
                writers may put their free poetry here.

                        Posting poems is the first way a member can contribute to the site. On your user page during a
                        session, you
                        will be able to submit your poem. Include a title with text, and you are all set!

                        Reading poems is a varying experience, but haikus are currently the dominant work here. This
                        site welcomes other types of short poems too such as free verse. View counters on other writing
                        sites may cause larger works to outshine smaller ones... Thus, it was omitted for the sake of
                        equal representation of poetry here.

                This is a project done for the CSCI&dash;12 class at El Camino College. I made this to pay homage to
                free online writing sites.
                As for the code, it will be kept within a private GitHub repo, but the color palettes are free from
                <code>colorpalettes.net</code>!<br>
