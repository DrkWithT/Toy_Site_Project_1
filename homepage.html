      <p>
        There are many online writing sites where people can compose written works, both fictional or non-fictional. Poetry is one of the types of writing on them, and this is a good place for it! Here, novice to experienced writers may put their free poetry here, and they can like other fellow writers' poems.

            Posting poems is the first way a member can contribute to the site. On your user page during a session, you will be able to submit your poem. Include a title with text, and you are all set!

            Liking poems written by your fellow writers is another way one can contribute. This lets your favorite authors know that their work is appreciated. However, liking posts are only available to logged in users only once per poem. The rated poem cannot be their own work.

        This is a project done for the CSCI&dash;12 class at El Camino College. I made this as a small homage to free, online writing sites.
        As for the code, it will be restricted within a private GitHub repo, but the color palettes are free!<br>
