      <p>
        There are many online writing sites where people can compose written works, both fictional or non-fictional.
        Poetry is one of the types of writing on them, and this is a good place for it! Here, novice to experienced
        writers may put their free poetry here, and they can like other fellow writers' poems.

            Posting poems is the first way a member can contribute to the site. On your user page during a session, you
            will be able to submit your poem. Include a title with text, and you are all set!
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <img class="side-img" alt="sticky notes image" src="./public/img/sticky_notes_wallpaperflare.png">
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="side-img-box">
        <div>
          <img class="side-img" alt="thumbs up image" src="./public/img/thumbs_up_clipart.png">
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            Liking poems written by your fellow writers is another way one can contribute. This lets your favorite
            authors know that their work is appreciated. However, liking posts are only available to logged in users
            only once per poem. The rated poem cannot be their own work.

        This is a project done for the CSCI&dash;12 class at El Camino College. I made this to pay homage to free online writing sites.
        As for the code, it will be kept within a private GitHub repo, but the color palettes are free from <code>colorpalettes.net</code>!<br>
